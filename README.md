## <center><u><span style="color:blue">Plugin Description:</u></center>

### <center><u><span style="color:cyan">For All Users:</u></center>

<b>FeelingLucky</b> is a mechanics plugin designed to expand upon the Luck attribute which Minecraft provides.
Each user is assigned a tangible Luck stat, which can be viewed by using <b><span style="color:violet">/luck info</color></b>.
Users can <i>increase</i> their luck stat by using a rabbit's foot, 
or increase their luck and their luck multiplier by consuming a special rabbits foot purchased from a Butcher villager.
<b><span style="color:red">Beware</b> though, if you take damage from guardian lasers or a witch's potion, 
there's a chance your luck will <i>decrease</i> instead.

### <center><u><span style="color:pink">For Administrators:</u></center>
Admins can modify values in the configuration file, as well as modify individual user's luck stat.
Admins can set, reset, add to, and take from player's luck stat.
Admins can also reload the main configuration, as well as individual and all player configurations.
For this, the command is <b><span style="color:violet">/luck reload -m</color></b> for the main config, 
<b><span style="color:violet">/luck reload</color></b> to reload all player configurations, and <b><span style="color:violet">/luck reload -p <i>PLAYER_NAME</i></span></b> to reload individual player configuration files.
